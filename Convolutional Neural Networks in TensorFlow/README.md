In the first course in this specialization, you had an introduction to TensorFlow, and how, with its high level APIs you could do basic image classification, and you learned a little bit about Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). In this course you'll go deeper into using ConvNets will real-world data, and learn about techniques that you can use to improve your ConvNet performance, particularly when doing image classification!In Week 1, this week, you'll get started by looking at a much larger dataset than you've been using thus far: The Cats and Dogs dataset which had been a Kaggle Challenge in image classification!

Learning Objectives:

* Gain understanding about Kerasâ€™ utilities for pre-processing image data, in particular the ImageDataGenerator class

* Develop helper functions to move files around the filesystem so that they can be fed to the ImageDataGenerator

* Learn how to plot training and validation accuracies to evaluate model performance

* Build a classifier using convolutional neural networks for performing cats vs dogs classification
